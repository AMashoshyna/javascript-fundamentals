# JavaScript Fundamentals

Welcome! This is a repository with learning materials for JavaScript Fundamentals course. The course is based on Kyle Simpson's [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) book series.

These materials may be useful for you, if you:
- realise you have gaps in vanilla JS knowledge
- need a refresher before job interview
- struggle with a particular subject

The course is not targeted at complete beginners. If you are new to JavaScript, we recommend taking a look at [these excercises](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/js-basics.md) first.
